<hr>

<p><b>The National Association of Independent Insurance Adjusters</b>, the NAIIA, is an association of approximately 300 independently-owned property and casualty claims adjusting companies located throughout the United States.</p>
<br>
<p>The NAIIA is organized because of a principle...
that a successful industry requires independent professionals interested also in the welfare of their individual communities. Our member firms have been approved by insurance carriers for their competency and ethical procedures as demonstrated in the hundreds of communities in which they operate. These firms have exhibited their willingness and ability to meet the strict standards of this association.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Mark your calendars for the 77th Annual Conference, set for June 25th to 28th at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale, AZ.</p>
